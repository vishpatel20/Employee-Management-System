# Employee-Management-System

This is a employee management system I made for my programming III course at Middlesex Community College. It will explain how inheritance and composition
works while simultaneously explaining how a employee is added into a system for a job.

This program is a real life example of how HR would add an employee into their system except my program is a simplified version of it. It explains concepts to 
basic java really well. It has a lot of comments as well so anyone who views my code can understand what each file is doing. 

Enjoy!!!
